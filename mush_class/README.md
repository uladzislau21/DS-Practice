# Mushrooms classification

This project was completed in frame of Math of DS course.

The main goal was to apply studied concepts (SVM, PCA).

In the project I used the 
[data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom) 
from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

First, EDA was performed to find relation between variables, data was 
visualised. Secondly, data pre-processing including feature encoding was 
carried out. PCA was performed to check wherher there are difference 
between two classes. Namely, 2- and 3-components PCA were checked. Lastly, 
we used SVM to classify different mushrooms to two classes. Performance 
was checked by confusion matrix as well as by plotting decision boundaries 
of classifier.

In conclusion, SVM performed perfectly on the mushrooms data, producing 0 
FP and FN.
